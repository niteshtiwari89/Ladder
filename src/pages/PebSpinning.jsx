                                sheds are facilities where raw cotton is processed into a usable fiber. The process begins with PEB spinning, which involves separating the seeds from the cotton fibers. This is done using a machine called a cotton gin, which separates the fibers from the seeds by pulling them through a series of wire screens and saw-toothed disks.
                                Once the seeds have been removed, the cotton fibers are cleaned and prepared for spinning. This is done using a variety of machines, such as carding machines and drawing frames, which comb and straighten the fibers.

                                The fibers are then spun into yarn, which is used to make a variety of products, including clothing, bedding, and towels. Ginning sheds are typically large, industrial facilities that are equipped with a range of machines and equipment to process raw cotton into usable fiber.
